## Introduction
This Application uses Gatsbyjs. Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. It weaves together the best parts of React, webpack, react-router, GraphQL, and other front-end tools in to one very enjoyable developer experience. It is similar to Nextjs but it has better performance for smaller sites (like this one).

### Frameworks Used
* Gatsby - Static Site Generator for React
* Axios - Make HTTP requests or XMLHttpRequests. Supports promises. No parsing needed.
* Redux - State Management System to Pass State Between Pages
