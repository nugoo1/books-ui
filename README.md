## Introduction
This Application uses Gatsbyjs. Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. It weaves together the best parts of React, webpack, react-router, GraphQL, and other front-end tools in to one very enjoyable developer experience. It is similar to Nextjs but it has better performance for smaller sites (like this one).
